Examples
=============

Most examples have been distributed into the services directory. 
For example, database examples will now be found under services/database/examples_and_test_scripts 
and so on for other services.  
services/core/examples_and_test_scripts will contain examples for compute, networking, block volume, etc.

Scripts found under a examples_and_test_scripts/ directory and named as "example_*" or "test_*" are tested via automation.

The examples are meant to be executed from the top level python-cli directory.
